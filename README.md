# Deep-Learning-Neural-Networks-for-Financial-Forecasting-of-Cryptocurrencies

Cryptocurrencies have unquestionably been a popular financial trend in recent years because they allow investors to use these decentralised commodities as a method of exchange. For numerous investors, the surge in the number of alternative crypto coins has resulted in both profits and losses. The cryptocurrency market is particularly volatile and unpredictable due to its decentralised structure. As a result, various researchers, investors, and crypto innovators are working to forecast the future of these currencies in order to make more informed financial judgments. The goal of this study is to create and compare two deep learning neural network models for predicting the prices of three different cryptocurrencies. The Convolutional Neural Network and Long Short-Term Memory Recurrent Neural Networks are created and evaluated based on evaluation metrics to see which model performs the best. The experiment reveals that the most accurate prediction for Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Binance Coin is a 4-year non-stationary RNN-LSTM model
